1. I was unable to access the functions from utils.py and utils2.py so I pasted them in a block inside the notebook
2. In the output of lrCostFunction where we had to print the cost and gradient I made some changes in the print part of the calling function. The output will still be there. 
3. converting y to a vector having 0s and 1s in part 2 nnCostFunction  was a part I faced some issue in knowing the dimensions
